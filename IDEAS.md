Maybe instead of trying to trace the points with curves to create boundaries for the squares...

We could instead expand the radius of each point to fill the available space. We expand each point simultaneously by the same change in radius. Points stop expanding where they touch their neighbors, but they continue expanding elsewhere on their perimeter until they touch neighbors there. Then we are left with a bunch of shapes that all perfectly fill space and are arranged according to the golden ratio.
